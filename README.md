# Flask-Flight Price Predictor

## Overview

This repository contains the materials and code for the Flight Price Predictor web app, which is made by using machine learning models using Flask. The app covered interpreting learning curves, evaluating and selecting models, creating a web application with Flask and deploying the app using Render.

## Project Details

### Learning Curves and Model Evaluation

- **Understanding Learning Curves**: We explored how learning curves can be used to identify underfitting and overfitting in models.
- **Model Selection**: We used learning curves to evaluate various models and select the best-performing one for our flight price prediction task.

### Web Application Development

- **Flask**: We built a web application using the Flask framework.
- **WTForms**: We integrated WTForms for handling web forms and input validation.
- **HTML Templates**: We utilized HTML templates with Jinja2 for dynamic content rendering.
- **Template Inheritance**: We applied template inheritance to create reusable and maintainable templates.

### API Serving and Deployment

- **Model Serving**: The trained machine learning model was served as an API using Flask.
- **Deployment**: The final Flask application was deployed using Render, making the web app accessible online.
